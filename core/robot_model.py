"""
Robot Model Builder — Phase 2 of the Fusion URDF Exporter.

Takes a FusionSnapshot (Phase 1 output) and builds a RobotModel:
  - Resolves joint occurrence paths (local → global)
  - Builds assembly hierarchy from occurrence paths
  - Auto-detects root link (no base_link naming requirement)
  - Resolves name collisions (prefix only when necessary)
  - Classifies joints (internal vs mount/cross-assembly)
  - Computes URDF joint origins (parent-relative)
  - Computes mesh bake offsets for revolute/prismatic children
  - Validates kinematic tree

Pure Python — no Fusion API imports. Testable with serialized snapshot.

# DEBUG / THEORY — joint origin rotation (pendulum bug, 2026-04-13)
#
# Symptom: a pendulum authored in Fusion with a revolute joint that
# visually hangs straight down in the assembly came out of the URDF
# exporter with the rod extending along the link's local +Y axis
# instead of -Z.  The CoM landed 30° off the joint's rotation axis,
# so physics equilibrium was at joint θ ≈ -30° rather than 0, and
# consumers had to hand-edit the xacro with rpy compensators on
# visual/collision/joint-origin to make the simulation behave.
#
# Theory: Fusion represents a joint mate with two `JointOrigin`
# objects — one on each mated occurrence — each carrying BOTH a
# position AND an orientation.  When the mate is applied, the child
# occurrence's `transform2` captures the resulting design pose
# relative to its parent assembly.  The rotation part of that
# transform is the orientation the user actually assembled.
#
# Until now the exporter:
#   • captured `transform2.rotation` on each FusionOccurrence
#     (fusion_extractor._extract_transforms → _extract_rotation), BUT
#   • only accumulated translation through the assemblyContext chain
#     when computing `global_transform` (rotation stayed at identity),
#   • never read orientation from `geometryOrOriginOne/Two`, and
#   • hardcoded URDF `<joint><origin rpy="0 0 0"/>` at
#     `_build_joints` line ~808 with the comment "No rotation — link
#     frames are global-aligned".
#
# Net effect: the user's assembled orientation was silently dropped
# and every downstream consumer had to recover it from CoM geometry.
#
# Fix (this change):
#   1. Walk the same assemblyContext chain that `_extract_transforms`
#      walks for translation, but for rotation — multiply the local
#      rotations together to get a real global rotation on
#      `FusionOccurrence.global_transform.rotation`.
#   2. In `_build_joints`, compute the URDF joint origin rpy as the
#      child occurrence's global rotation expressed in the parent's
#      global frame (R_parent⁻¹ · R_child), converted to extrinsic
#      XYZ Euler angles (URDF rpy convention: R = Rz·Ry·Rx).
#   3. Log what we extracted so this is visible in the export log.
#
# Scope / limitations:
#   • Handles revolute, prismatic, and fixed joints the same way —
#     the child's pose at rest is whatever Fusion mated it to.
#   • Does NOT read `JointOrigin.geometry` orientation (second-order
#     improvement — transform2 already captures the effective pose
#     for standard mates).
#   • Nested assemblies are handled via context-chain accumulation;
#     if a non-identity transform sits between the joint's owning
#     assembly and a mated occurrence, it composes correctly.
#   • Assumes right-handed, orthonormal rotation matrices (true for
#     Fusion `Matrix3D`).  No orthonormalisation pass on output.

# rigid group in Fusion now means "treat as one body" for URDF: pick an
# anchor (explicit frame-only member first, otherwise heaviest
# non-collision member), aggregate mass / CoM / inertia via
# parallel-axis theorem in the anchor's local frame, build a merged AABB
# from physical members, and remove every non-anchor leaf from occ_to_asm
# so downstream stages see only the anchor.  Joints touching any member
# get redirected to the anchor (see _resolve_joint_paths).

    Resolve a joint's local occurrence path to (assembly, component, full_path).

    Returning ``full_path`` is the key disambiguator: when a component
    is reused (e.g. ``leva:1`` and ``leva:2``), every (asm, clean_name)
    lookup collides and one of the occurrences is silently lost.  The
    full_path is unique per occurrence; downstream lookups use it as
    the canonical key.

    Logic:
      1. Check if clean name is a flattened collision sub-assembly → redirect
      2. Find candidates in ``occ_to_asm`` matching path suffix + clean
         name; prefer match in defining assembly.
      3. If nothing found in occ_to_asm, the target may have been
         collapsed into a rigid-group anchor.  Find the leaf's
         full_path in ``snapshot.occurrences``, look up the redirect
         by full_path, and return the anchor's (asm, clean, full_path).
      4. If the target is a container-only subassembly, redirect to that
         subassembly's deterministic URDF root link.
      5. Fallback: suffix-only match in occ_to_asm.

    # while mating occurrences in Fusion — e.g. on a simple pendulum,
    # the pendel rod ended up along the link's local +Y instead of
    # hanging straight down.

    # The rotation was never missing from the snapshot: Fusion stored
    # it on `occurrence.transform2`, and our extractor captured it
    # (fusion_extractor._extract_rotation).  It just never made it to
    # the URDF.
    #
    # From now on, for every joint we compose the child occurrence's
    # transform2 rotation through the assemblyContext chain, express it
    # relative to the parent's composed rotation, and emit the result
    # as `<joint><origin rpy>` in extrinsic XYZ Euler angles.

    # Verified against the pendulum snapshot: `pendel.transform2`
